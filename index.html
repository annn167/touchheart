    <p>Charity is giving of whatever resources we have in order to meet the need of another.A charitable donation is a gift 
        of cash or property made to a nonprofit organization to help it accomplish its goals,
         for which the donor receives nothing of value in return. In the north America,
          donations can be deducted from the federal tax returns of individuals and companies

    <p> Agriculture initiatives are often run by organizations (1) relying on volunteer structures; (2) growing produce sustainably; and (3) aiming to improve health and access to food in their communities.Farming

        To clarify “growing produce sustainably,” the Utah Conservation Corps Urban Community Farm (UCCUCF) (a volunteer and AmeriCorps-driven community agriculture model based in Logan, Utah) engages in the following regenerative agriculture practices:
        
        Using crop diversification and companion planting (allowing for increased pest control, building healthy soil, shade benefits, reducing available space for weeds, and more).
        Rotating crops (building healthy soil, reducing buildup of certain pest/disease populations, and replenishing soil nutrients).
        Planting cover crops (protecting soil and reducing erosion, and increasing organic matter and nutrient content of soil).
        Focusing on plant varieties that are suitable for our specific climate (using drought or low-water-tolerant plants adapted to local soil and climatic conditions to avoid fighting nature or putting more resources into growing healthy plants than necessary).
        Using native plant species where possible (especially pollinator-friendly plants like wildflowers to increase the presence of bees, birds, etc.).
        Watering on specific schedules, mainly via dripline (delivering irrigation directly to the roots and only where desired so minimal water is wasted, and watering during the coolest part of the day so minimal water is lost due to evaporation).
        Using organic pest/weed control where possible, and always implementing integrated pest management (releasing ladybugs to biologically control aphids, using oil traps to control earwigs, building a high-quality fence to keep deer out, using weed barrier fabric, etc.).
        Composting (turning garden waste, fallen leaves, food scraps and more into natural fertilizer that increases yield </p>

        we aim to uplift communities towards independence in this bold new digital world.Education through ICT has become the golden thread that runs through our entire strategy.
        Investing in education is at the core of charity's social investment strategy. In line with this, the charity Foundation has identified a gap in the special needs learning environment
         and the urgency with which education should become more inclusive.
         Working with various stakeholders, 
        including the Department of Education, the Department of Social Development and the National Development Agency, the Foundation has developed interventions
